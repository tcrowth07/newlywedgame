# Newlywed Game by Ty Crowther

This is a simple web application I designed and built for Dr. Liddles IS542 class. It allows you to challenge your spouse/girlfriend/boyfriend to see which of you knows the other better. The goal for the app was to make it easy to start immediatley playing the newlywed game right from your browser, instead of installing an app or having to register an account.
